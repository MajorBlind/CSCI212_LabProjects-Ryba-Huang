## Getting Started

Lab 4 uses class `Money.java` to handle how it processes money:
- Adding to different amount together and handling when cents exceed 100 (== 1 dollar)
- Identifies if two amounts of money are the same
- Enforces the concept that `==` operator and `isEqualTo` function handle objects differently and its differences (Briefly explained in comments in `MoneyMain.java`)
- Gets you more comfortable with making new objects of a class and calling class functions within main file

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
